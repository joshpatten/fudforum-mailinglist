FUDForum mailing list modifications

More to come here, I just created this repo so it will take me a while to organize Everything

The idea behind this project is to turn FUDforum into a fully functional mailing list system instead of relying on an external mailing list.

With the help of Postfix, this is possible. This readme will soon contain information on how to install and configure, as well as what specific items need to be addressed when adding mailing lists

Also, this repository will contain an Atlassian Crowd Authentication plugin. It will likely need to be modified to your environment as each environment is different.
